			Recognition Portal is online Performance Appraisal 
			and Recognition system used by all the employees in 
			different sections of the company. Salary hike and 
			promotion depends upon the employee performance. 
			This portal is a one stop shop for all the employees 
			to provide details like tasks performed and 
			performance measures improved etc to their superiors. 
			It allows superiors to evaluate and analyze the employee’s 
			performance and work done by him and target achieved in a 
			given period of time and to rate him. It provides a very 
			good interface between superiors and subordinates. Based on 
			these ratings and overall performance shown by employees ranks 
			will be allotted to them among the group of employees with same 
			designation. This rank is called consolidated rank. 
			This is the basic criteria for recognizing employee’s performance 
			and to provide salary hike/promotion to any employee.</h5>
